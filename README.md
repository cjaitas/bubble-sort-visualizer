## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking
I chose bubble sort as it is a simple, easy to understand sorting algorithm that uses many steps to complete the list. Its repetetive comparisons and swaps make it easy to visualize through animated bars. 

Decomposition:
Bubble sort can be broken down into smaller steps
1. Start at the first index of the list
2. Compare current value with the next value
3. If first value is greater than the second, swap them
4. Move to the next pair and repeat
5. After each full pass the largest value should be at the end of the list
6. Continue untill sorted

Pattern Recognition:


## Steps to Run:
1. Enter list of numbers separated with commas
2. Click the 'Start Sorting' button to start sorting the list
3. Click the 'Next Step' button to view the sorting process step by step
